Please build your page in `exercise2/index.html`. You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `exercise2` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

### Assets

* The text on the page is included in `exercise2/assets/text.txt`
