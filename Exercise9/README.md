## Exercise 9 - NodeJS

*Please ensure you have watched the pre-recorded lectures on `npm` and `nodejs` before completing this activity.*

A javascript file that can be run with `node` has been created in `Exercise9/numbers.js`. You must complete this program to analyse the numbers and print out the following result using the `console.log` function to print:

A list of numbers has been provided at the top of the file, and your output needs to print:
 * The sum of all numbers in that list
 * The sum of only positive numbers in that list
 * The sum of only even numbers in that list
 * The sum of all numbers above 400
 * The sum of numbers between array index 20 and 40 inclusively

The expected output should be (replacing X with correct answers):
```txt
Sum = X
Positive Sum = X
Even Sum = X
Sum of numbers above 400 = X
Sum of numbers between indexes 20 and 40 inclusively = X
```
