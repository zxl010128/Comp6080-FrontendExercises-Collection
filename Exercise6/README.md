## Exercise 6 - HTML & CSS

Build a page that looks identical to `Exercise6/page.png`. The window width you should work with is 475 x 1953 pixels. You are only allowed to use HTML and CSS for this task. No external libraries are permitted.

Please build your page in `Exercise6/index.html`. You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `Exercise6` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

### Assets

* Your fonts do not need to match exactly. You may use font-family `Helvetica` or `sans-serif` for the page.
* Assets can be found in `Exercise6/assets` which you can use for your solution.
